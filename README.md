# React Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This project is a React-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a twist: you play as 'X' against an AI bot that plays as 'O'. The game is designed to be simple yet challenging, as the bot is programmed to make smart moves based on the current state of the board.

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against a challenging AI bot.
- **React Functional Components**: Built using modern React, leveraging hooks and state management.
- **Smart AI**: The bot is designed to block your moves and try to win the game.
